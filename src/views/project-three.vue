            <h2 class="sub-title">My rol</h2>
            <p>I designed the wireframe and the mockup, also I developed the website with WordPress and deployed on a host.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Wireframe -->
        <div class="project-description">
            <h2 class="sub-title">wireframes</h2>
            <p>I decided to make a simple design, easy to read, and the gallery had to be simple to edit cause the client had to add new paintings or delete when a painting was sell.
            The way to navigate the website is trough the men√∫, where each section is displayed on a single screen.</p>

    <!-- Mockup -->
    <div class="project">
        <h2 class="sub-title">Mockup</h2>
        <p>For the final design I presented alternative colors and different ways of present the paintings. With the client we decided to use the following design for its simplicity for modify the paintings gallery. </p> <br>

    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h2 class="sub-title">Development</h2>

        <p>I choose WordPress cause fit's very well with the kind of project and is self-manageable, after we deploy the website the client asked for another page that to show the paintings orders,(the section called "encargos") where the client has to add paintings.</p> <br>
